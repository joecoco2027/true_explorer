## When Less Becomes More: The Wisdom of Simplicity

In a village tucked between misty mountains and endless rice fields, lived an old carpenter named Danu. He was not famous, not rich, and certainly not flashy. But anyone who had ever sat on one of his chairs said it felt like sitting inside a memory—solid, simple, and somehow eternal.

Danu lived in a modest hut with nothing more than the essentials: a small cot, a clay stove, a single iron pot, and a shelf with three books—one of poems, one of prayers, and one of silence. Yes, silence. It was a blank journal, gifted to him by his father, where he wrote only when he had nothing left to say.
